# GWU bootcamp pandas-challenge
GWU week 4 challenge assignment

For the George Washington University data analytics bootcamp I completed this analysis challenge.

For this assignment we were tasked to analyse the district-wide standardized test results provided to us in this assignment using pandas and Jupiter Notebooks. This to get us more familiar with the pandas library. The dataset consisted of data from a fictive school district that needed to be analysed to be presented to stakeholders.

Quick run-through of the application I wrote:
- Part 1
Importing all the necessary libraries and merging the data frames to create one dataset that would be sued throughout the analysis.

Part 2
The first 5 cells are meant to create a quick view of the dataset with some key metrics shown.

Part 3
The next 6 cells are to prepare the data frame for further analysis and the summery we provide at the end and collect key metrics.

Part 4
A high level snapshot of the districts key metrics was created.

Part 5
Here the dataset was filtered to show insights into the students passing rate and get results per school and school district on the key metrics.

Part 6 
The results are merged into a summery data frame. I merge on the left to make sure the data was added to the rows and all data was merged into the data frame.

Part 7
The dataset was filtered on groups of students in certain grades. To show the performance on the key metrics per grade.

Part 8
Using binning the dataset got 4 labels added in a new column showing the spending ranges and the school sizes

Part 9
I renamed 3 columns for clarity and calculated averages were added. Then I created a new data frame. I used concat as it presented the dataset in the most effective manner.

Part 10
Two final data frame summaries were created to show the performance per school on key metrics compared to the size of the school and the score per district on key metrics. 

My conclusions:
Large schools as well as district schools seem to have lower overall passing rates than Charter schools. It would be interesting to add more context in further analysis to gain more insights into what is driving this difference.
